# Simple JSON REST Server a la Heroku
This project is set up to run the [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) node module on Heroku.

To install it on your own Heroku, you don't need to make any changes to this code.
Just follow similar instructions to
[Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

## Configure Collections
The database starts with two empty collections by default: /rooms and /students.
Modify `db.json` to change this.
